MongoDB and Mongoose are related but serve different purposes in a Node.js application. Here's a comparison and explanation of both:

### MongoDB
- **Type**: Database
- **Role**: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format.
- **Usage**: It provides a high-performance, highly available, and easily scalable database solution. It allows for the storage of large amounts of data and the retrieval of this data using its querying language.
- **Connection**: Directly using the MongoDB Node.js driver to interact with the database.

### Mongoose
- **Type**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js
- **Role**: Mongoose provides a higher-level abstraction on top of the MongoDB driver by offering schema-based solutions to model your application data.
- **Features**:
  - **Schemas**: Define the structure of your documents and models.
  - **Validation**: Provides built-in validation for data.
  - **Middleware**: Supports middleware for pre and post hooks.
  - **Plugins**: Extendable with plugins for additional functionality.
- **Usage**: It simplifies the process of writing MongoDB validation, casting, business logic, and more.
  
### Example Explanation

In your code example, Mongoose is used to connect to a MongoDB database. Here's a breakdown of how the connection is established:

1. **Importing Mongoose**:
   ```javascript
   const mongoose = require("mongoose");
   ```
   This line imports the Mongoose library.

2. **Creating an Asynchronous Function to Connect to the Database**:
   ```javascript
   const connectDb = async () => {
     try {
       const connect = await mongoose.connect(process.env.CONNECTION_STRING);
       console.log(
         "Database connected: ",
         connect.connection.host,
         connect.connection.name
       );
     } catch (err) {
       console.log(err);
       process.exit(1);
     }
   };
   ```
   - The `connectDb` function is defined as an asynchronous function.
   - Within the `try` block, Mongoose's `connect` method is called with the connection string, which returns a promise. When resolved, it returns a connection object.
   - The connection object contains information about the connected host and database name, which is logged to the console.
   - If an error occurs during connection, it is caught in the `catch` block, logged, and the process exits with a failure status.

3. **Exporting the `connectDb` Function**:
   ```javascript
   module.exports = connectDb;
   ```
   This line exports the `connectDb` function so it can be imported and used in other parts of the application.

### Summary
- **MongoDB**: The database itself, handling data storage and retrieval.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM library that provides a schema-based solution to model your application data, offering additional features like validation and middleware.

By using Mongoose, you get an easier and more structured way to interact with MongoDB, making it a popular choice for Node.js applications.

To connect to a MongoDB database without using Mongoose, you can use the native MongoDB Node.js driver.
